# TECHNICAL TEST

This repository contains the technical test for a data scientist position. The purpose of this test is the exploitation of data bases featuring the actions acquired for one player during a game to generate the game as a dictionary (key: action label, value: tracker acceleration norm).

To run this code, you have to run the main.py file, following these steps:
    - clone the repository with the following command in the git bash:
    `git clone https://github.com/mhochart/tech_test.git`
    - navigate to the cloned repository then run the main file:
    `py main.py`

First a matplotlib window will appear with an actions analysis. Then, when closing this window a file game_recreation.json is generated.
